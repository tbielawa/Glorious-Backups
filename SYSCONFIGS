Included in the examples is an lgb script for backing up system
configuration settings called "gbackups-sysconf.d". Installing and
configuring it is simple. Here's an example showing how.

  1. Make the directory the sysconf.d configs are stored in:
     mkdir -p /etc/gbackups-sysconf.d

  2. Install the backup script into the glorious backups scripts directory:
     cp /usr/share/glorious-backups/examples/gbackups-sysconf.lgb /etc/gbackups.d/

  3. Create a configuration to backup all of /etc/httpd:
     echo "/etc/httpd" > /etc/gbackups-sysconf.d/httpd

  4. Create a configuration to handle Glorious Backups:
     echo "/etc/gbackups.d" > /etc/gbackups-sysconf.d/gbackups

Config file format:

  One or more files or directory paths in a plain text file, stored in
    /etc/gbackups-sysconf.d


Testing:

  As root run 'gloriously-backup'
