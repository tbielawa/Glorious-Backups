lcsee-glorious-backups for LOUD
---------------------------------

INTRODUCTION
------------

This package is used to GLORIOUSLY backup services via a centralized system which
isolates outside information from the utilities which actually prep backup data to
be moved. Essentially, you have a series of scripts in /etc/gbackups.d/ which are
run to create the backup data and place it neatly in /srv/lcsee-backups/. After
this is done, gloriously-backup rsyncs all the data in that directory to the
backups file server (designated in LDAP via: cn=backups). Information is
isolated such that the backup generation scripts in /etc/gbackups.d/ don't know
where data is being placed or sent to, and gloriously-backup doesn't know what
utilities will run. This prevents a problem of generality and makes it easy to
keep all backup utilities uniform.


SCRIPTS: /etc/gbackups.d/
-------------------------

Scripts placed in /etc/gbackups.d/ that end in .lgb (see the glorious acronym?)
are executed by gloriously-backup each time it executes. The purpose of these
scripts is to actually do the backup process (ie. mysqldump, slapcat, etc.) and
place their final backup data in /srv/lcsee-backups/ ready for gloriously-backup
to rsync to the backup file server. These scripts need not do anything more
than this, and do not need to know where they're actually placing the data nor
what file server they're being placed on. This is all provided by the native
glory library functions that must be sourced in each script. A good idea is to
have the following header in each script (where "SERVICE NAME" is replaced with
the actual service, ie. rt, svn, ldap, etc.):

--- START CODE ---

#!/bin/bash

SERVICE="SERVICE NAME"

# Include glorious backups library
if [ -e /usr/lib/glory ]; then
    . /usr/lib/glory
else
    echo "Glorious backups library not found."
    echo "Are you sure that lcsee-glorious-backups is installed?"
    apt-cache policy lcsee-glorious-backups | egrep "(Installed|Candidate|Unable)"
    exit 1;
fi

--- END CODE ---

From here, native functions are provided which provide the local directory to
data in, as well as providing file names for current day-of-week tagged dump
files, bzip and gzip files. Those functions are described in the next section.

GLORY HOLES
-----------

This section outlines potential bugs or holes in the glorious backup system.

* Currently, most systems utilize a standard "backup stuff, toss it in
  /srv/lcsee-backups/" method. However, some other systems (ie. minid) use
  an alternative approach (ie. placing a symlink to /srv/bronze/). Because
  of this, the rsync flags in gloriously-backup include --follow-symlinks,
  thus if symlinks are not carefully checked for loops, this could break the
  backup system.

* Most systems toss a single file into /srv/lcsee-backups/ for each day,
  however some others (ie. wv3c) include multiple files. These are tossed
  into an additional directory named data/. This is accomplished by
  performing a sed on functions which return a full path. Because of this,
  concurrency must be maintained in maintenance of this package.
